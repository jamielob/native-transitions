#Native Transitions for Meteor Mobile Apps

##Status bar
You'll need to style your status bar to make things look nice.
```meteor add mobile-status-bar```

```
Meteor.startup(function() {
	if (Meteor.isCordova) {
		//Format the status bar
		StatusBar.overlaysWebView(false);
		StatusBar.styleLightContent();
		StatusBar.backgroundColorByHexString("#2f3339");
	}
});
```

##Settings file

If you want to change any of the default global settings you can create a settings file wrapped in an isCordova statement.  


##Header bar
If you want your header bar to remain static while the page transitions then you can add the following to your settings file.

```
	if (Meteor.isCordova) {
		nt.fadeHeader = true;
		nt.defaults.fixedPixelsTop = 44;
	}
```

##Completed callback

You can pass a callback function in to nt.transition() and it will be called once the transition is completed.


##Speed
Don't put too much on a single page otherwise the transition will have a delay.  Check out the native-transitions-tabs package for your core app pages.


##Router
Although this package doesn't depend on FlowRouter, it's the best one to use with it.
The native-transitions-tabs package does depend on FlowRouter, making use of the reactive query params.


##Companion app warning

```Probably running inside a companion app, your app may crash if your html file is not in the root!```

This warning is generated by the cordova plugin and can be safely ignored for your Meteor app.  I'm working on hiding it.

##Flickers and slow downs

If you are seeing a flicker of the page that you are headed to at the start of your transition then you might just need some more content! It usually happens because the page that you are loading is loaded so quickly that you see it before the screenshot of the old page can be displayed.   Try adding some dummy CSS styles content and see if it fixes it for you.

At the other end of the spectrum, flickers and slow downs can sometimes be because a page has too much content.  Try lightening the load and be sure to text on older devices!
